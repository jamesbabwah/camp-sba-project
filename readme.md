## Problem Solving SBA solution
This project was part of the programming section of my group's Information Technology School Based Assessment.

## How to run
Run the file and follow the instructions for a demo. To see a sample output without inputting anything run `cat sample_input.txt | python3 solution.py` in powershell. This doesn't work properly on WSL for some reason.

*This project requires python 3.10 or above to execute*
